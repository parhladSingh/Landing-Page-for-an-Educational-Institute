              Bootstrap is a statistical resampling technique that has gained popularity in the field of data analysis and machine learning. It is a powerful tool used to estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic or model parameter, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

            <p>
              The basic idea behind bootstrap is to simulate multiple datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. This means that each bootstrap sample is created by randomly selecting data points from the original dataset, allowing some data points to be selected multiple times, while others may not be selected at all. By constructing multiple bootstrap samples, we can generate a distribution of sample statistics or model parameters.

            <p>
              Bootstrap can also be applied to various types of models, including regression models, classification models, and more complex machine learning algorithms. It can help evaluate the stability of model parameters, assess the predictive performance of a model, and quantify the uncertainty associated with model predictions.

            <p>
              The bootstrap samples are used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic of interest. For example, if we want to estimate the mean of a population, we can calculate the mean for each bootstrap sample and then examine the distribution of these means. This distribution can provide valuable information about the uncertainty in our estimate and can be used to calculate confidence intervals.
