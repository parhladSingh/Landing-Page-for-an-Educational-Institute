              CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the visual appearance and layout of HTML documents. It provides a set of rules that define how elements on a webpage should be displayed, including properties like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

            <p>
              CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them using selectors. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, or other attributes. This allows developers to precisely target specific elements and apply unique styles to them.

            <h1>CSS - Lecture Two</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              CSS has evolved over time, and modern CSS features have expanded its capabilities significantly. CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less introduce advanced features such as variables, mixins, and nesting, making CSS code more maintainable and reusable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the primary benefits of CSS is its ability to apply styles consistently across multiple web pages. By defining styles in a separate CSS file or within the HTML document itself, developers can apply those styles to various elements throughout the website. This separation of concerns promotes code reusability and maintainability, as changes can be made in one place and automatically reflected across the entire site.
